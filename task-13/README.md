# Circuit Design
This task was suspiciously easy though I had a difficulty in understanding what exactly was the aim of the task. Since the parking conditions are just yes or no (car present or not) and the only parameters given are the position of the sensor and the 5m and 2m distance. 
I wrote the code to check prescence in a 3m radius(from the ceiling).
