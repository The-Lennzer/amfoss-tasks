# INTROSPECTION

## Why must we choose you?

I've really loved programming since my 10th grade and was determined to pursue it after school. The feeling of writing a code and fixing the bugs only to see the correct output appear before is a feeling from another level. I was really intrested in AI, virtual environment and asset creation and will eventually structure myself in that but my aim is to integrate these domains with foss so that there is increased accessibility to these domains. If I want one thing in life it is to end up being in my passion and it's something I'd work relentlessly for. I love to wrok with people and to integrate stuff with people of similar interests to create better stuff or maybe just for fun! I think foss club would be a great place for me to pursue my passion and to work with and find people of similar intrests as me.

## What is your plan for the next six months

My plan is to develop my coding skills and to set a good base in python and c++.Also, In the next few months I want to explore as much domains as possible and to find those I really love and develop an Intrest in and try and integrate them. I'm feel like i'm pretty ignorant of some things and want to change it up a lot and progress through all of it.

## How would you contribute back to the club?

I'm sure the perks of being in the foss-club is way better than what I expect or of the word that goes around and what better way is there to contribute back than to work with the club as a team and to bring glory to the name of the club XD , by that I mean having acheivements in the name of the club that increase the importance of the club overall!

## Feedback for the selection process

I must say this process is one of a kind and a kind i've never seen before. But the process, in my opinion, is really efficient because even if one doesn't make it into the club there's a lot of learning through the process that could guide a person to doing things by themselves and to help them find and understand new domains. The process is well structured and quite a lot to take at a first look but worth it!
