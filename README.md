## My Views About The Tasks<br>
The tasks were quite challenging and not something I'd like to say easy. I  think that the tasks helped me to venture into uncharted waters that helped me map my abilities. I know I haven't completed all the tasks and couldn't finish up a few but the experience throughout the tasks were really intresting and valuable. The tasks just don't give an overview about a topic but also makes us go deep and to understand the functions of the field and if that's not what learning is, then I don't know what is.
## My Introduction<br>
Heyya! Adithya here from kerala(tvm). I knew about foss club from quora and I didn't even know what foss was until I checked it out for myself and turns out the best way to make a difference in the computer tech Industry is the way of the foss. I was intriguid even with the limited info I had and I would really love to know more and to dive into the open world of foss ;). I just knew the basics of c++ and have been lost with connection to computers for a few years(jee problems). I got back up with a few hours of cs50 but the hackerank problems gave a tough time because of serious misunderstandings and not knowing the platform very well. I too believe that progress is the ultimate aim and not perfection, and every time I manage to do something I find difficult on my own I'm as happy as I ever could be.
