# INSTALL UBUNTU 20.04 [DESKTOP]
This was fairly a simple task considering it's smooth execution the first time I tried doing this. I run a laptop with 8 gigs of RAM and an intel core i3 11th generation processor so
it was fairly an easy task for me and it sure did run real smooth. I followed an online blog which had instruction on how to dual-boot ubuntu along with windows 10 on a desktop/laptop.<br/><br/>
You can find the blog [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-dual-boot-windows-10-and-linux-ubuntu-20-04-lts-in-a-few-hassle-free-steps-f0e465c3aafd).<br/><br/> All was well until this point, 
but then I tried installing it again on another computer and it did install correctly but the wifi drivers went missing and my laptop running ubuntu refused to connect to the internet unless I
could provide it with a wired connection. Then the laptop proceeded to shut me out of windows, asking for a bitlocker recovery key to continue working on windows and I did not even know what
that was. After a long time of research and surfing-the-net I found the key and got in.<br/><br/> Then I looked for a solution to my ubuntu problem and after trying out a lot of methods and failing at each and every one of them. I then 
decided that I'd look for some professiona help in this matter since I honestly did not want to venture into uncharted waters and get myself more deep in trouble than I already was.<br/><br/>
Still I worked on ubuntu in my first laptop where everything still runs smoothly :)
